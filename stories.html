    <h1>Poetry</h1>
    Poetry is like two twisted strings- one which has the facts, one which had the emotions. And they each come up alternatively. <br>
    Below is a poetry which tells a story in such a manner. 
    <br>PS: Hope you enjoy it...

<div class="textBox" id="seg2">
 
<h1>Eternal dance of sand and sea</h1>

<br>The courtyard by the woods sang soft and gold.
<br>The sun hung low over the blushing clouds
<br>The lights were dreamy, the air blew bold
<br>Deceptive happiness, a beautiful shroud
<br><br>
<br>The courtyard was big, with hard cobbled stones
<br>Which clapped when you danced, and clicked when you strolled.
<br>No longer did the red mud stank
<br>Of death and decay, when the water deserted its rank.
<br><br>
<br>And over the fence, you could still see that sea,
<br>Violet shades surfing white-blue sheens
<br>And the pale sand beach, warm on your skin,
<br>Soft like flour sinking underneath your feet.
<br>No stain remained whatsoever
<br>Of that great destructive tragedy.
<br><br>
<br>Today was special, the birds sang sweet.
<br>A forgotten melody, a bittersweet tweet
<br>Because a rosy fog had settled over the land,
<br>Because cakes were baked, gifted sweets in hand,
<br>Flowers in hair, love in command.
<br><br>
<br>And amidst that crowd, stood a single man.
<br>Strange in wear and ways.
<br>Distant shouts rung in his ears.
<br>Shadows from a faraway gaze.
<br><br>
<br>Then she emerged from that sea, 
<br>Oh so lovely and pale!
<br>Dark waves curling over a flickering frame.
<br>Fair dress, a storming sail.
<br><br>
<br>Eyes so dead, 
<br>yet bright with joy
<br>And a smile so sweet, 
<br>yet alluringly coy.
<br><br>
<br>She walked up to the man, and asked with a smile.
<br>“Won’t you take my hand tonight?
<br>The stars light up the heavens above
<br>My heart, it shines the same dazzling bright.”
<br><br>
<br>The man had waited thousand nights
<br>And thousand dawns he’d passed.
<br>Had seen the sea crash onto the beach
<br>An embrace which never lasts.
<br><br>
<br>Yet like those sands that long for his sea
<br>His hand, he held out and said
<br>‘I’ll be yours for eternity
<br>Until my soul is dead.’
<br><br>
<br>So like the sea and like the sand
<br>The lovers stepped on the stone.
<br>Swirling and twirling their transient dance
<br>Their eye in the moonlight shone.
<br><br>
<br>They danced with the others in the courtyard.
<br>They danced to the violin’s string.
<br>They danced with the wind, they dances to the flute.
<br>They dances with the colours of spring.
<br><br>
<br>Soft like whisper like gentle waves
<br>Loud like it’s stormy violent roars.
<br>Their love had lived through nature’s rage
<br>Their hearts now part of forgotten lores.
<br><br>
<br>Loud were the winds which once had blew
<br>Over the shaken land
<br>The waves consumed the ones who knew
<br>Brave stories buried in sand.
<br><br>
<br>Then at last, the music stopped,
<br>The waves receded, their hands unlocked
<br>The girl then cupped his cheeks and said
<br>“Remember me, till we meet again.”
<br>The boy smiled and nod his head
<br>“Together forever, in life and death.”
<br><br>
<br>A thousand nights, ten thousand more
<br>His eternal patience would survive.
<br>Because in the end, she was dead, 
<br>And neither was he alive.
<br><br>
<br>Forlorn in sighs, sadness in eyes
<br>The girl faded away.
<br>The boy kept watch from the shrouded shore
<br>Before he too dissolved in sands grey.

 <h1>Short Story</h1>
The below segment is one short story from an collection of short stories about the life and adventures of  girl <strike>named</strike> 
<i>not named</i> Lani from the land of Saorsa. The tone used is inocent humor and curiosity.

<div class="textBox" id="seg4">
 <h1>Eggs in the Microwave</h1>

 My name is not Lani. I am from a place called Saorsa. Which also, by the way, does not exist. But let’s all pretend it does.


<br><br>I got permission to enter the kitchen roughly around 10 years ago. So that would be when I was 8. I am not saying that I had never entered the kitchen before that. Just that it was usually under adult supervision. At first, I didn’t understand what could go wrong if I was left alone? I wasn’t an idiot. I was not going to go in there and stab myself with a knife or hold my hand over fire. I am a pyrophobe! Nothing could possibly go wrong.

<br><br>I was at Flynn’s house the day everything went wrong. His parents had gone to the clinic with his sister Gisele for she was not feeling well. That meant the entire house was under the mercy of two 10-year-olds. I really pitied that house later.

<br><br>Halfway through the car race…well Flynn called it a car race. My Mercedes was never on the road. Either on the foot walk or flying. Yes flying (of the road). I have the talent to make cars fly in Need For Speed. (a really cool car race game.)

<br><br>So Flynn said he was hungry. I too was hungry. We both went into the kitchen. I grabbed a packet of chips. Chips was an important dietary commodity required for proper growth and development of children. Sadly, very few people were aware of this fact.

<br><br>Flynn took an egg. A raw egg. At first, I thought he was going to eat it as such. He has done weirder things before. He was among the only few who could give me competition when it came to doing weird stuff.
 “What are you doing?” I asked, eating a chip. 

 <br><br>“Just wait and watch! Boiled eggs in thirty seconds!” He grinned as he opened the microwave and placed the egg inside.

 <br><br>“I don’t think we should be doing that.” I said as he closed the door and set the timer. “An egg isn’t boiled in that way. And…why are you even boiling an egg? I thought you were going to have chips.”
 
 <br><br>“Nonsense. My mother told me not to put metallic or plastic items inside. This egg is purely organic! Right out of the butt of a chicken!” Flynn declared proudly. I had a strong feeling that Flynn wasn’t actually going to eat the egg. He just wanted to try this out. Well, who was I to stop him? And I would be a liar if I said I wasn’t a least bit interested to see how it turned out. Plus, I would get bragging rights in school, along with Flynn.

 <br><br>I grinned slyly “Lets do this then!”

 <br><br>So of went the chicken’s butt organic egg round-n-round inside the microwave oven. Being the brave person I was, I pulled Flynn in front of me.

 <br><br>At first, nothing happened. I thought that this was actually going to work.

 <br><br>And then, the timer reached 10 sec. 

 <br><br>…Have you guys ever heard a canon ball explosion. Like in the movies. If you haven’t, just take a chicken’s butt egg and microwave it. Though be prepared to clean up the mess for one hour afterwards.

 <br><br>The egg exploded. It literally exploded. BOOM! Gone. Annihilated and pulverized, rather like the Mercedes I had just thrown of the cliff in the game. And the egg wasn’t the only thing that exploded.

 <br><br>Oh! The microwave was fine. (Just dirty and stinky). But when Flynn’s mother returned, I could swear that they heard her shriek all the way from Germany. And that’s quite far away. 

 <br><br>I never returned to Flynn’s house after that day. But he did come over quite a few times. Both of us became quite famous for a month in Saorsa. Our classmates were impressed. The old folks were not so impressed. My mother even barricaded off the kitchen whenever Flynn came along and even kept the fire extinguisher ready. Just in case.

 <br><br>I haven’t seen Flynn for a while now. I think I will go and talk to him for a while. Maybe even play Need For Speed in the Xbox 360. I have improved my driving. Hopefully, there will be no more organic explosions. Just the metallic ones in the game.

 <br><br>Love, Lani.
